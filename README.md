# RPG

An RPG implementing <a href="https://github.com/justinlee0777/rpg-game-engine" target="_blank">this game engine</a>. This is the UI/detailed implementation over the engine which only specifies game flow.

The instructions for the game are in the game itself. To run it locally, run in terminal:

```
npm ci
npm run start
```

I don't enjoy playing the game which means it is in need of an overhaul. The UI, in particular, is dreadful: it has too much white space and is not helpful to the player. That would be the first improvement.
